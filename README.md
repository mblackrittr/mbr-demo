# MBR | D E M O

**`Monorepo`** root (`/`) - mostly DevOps, centralized and shared by `apps/` and `packages/`.
  
For a "real product" and its features, you might want to check [MBR-Nuxonic](apps/nuxt-ionic).


## Features

  - Strongly opinionated conventions over configurations - *we're not building some geek-framework but set base for (maybe not only) pro-level Typescript development*.

  - Jumping the bandwagon and universe of [Effect](#effect-ts) - *for not only the mandatory mentioned fully typed errors and a hint of functional programming paradigms* - leveraging its rapidly growing eco-system of exceptional tooling like [Effect-DocGen][effect-ts:docgen] and support for our preferred framework(s) with [Effect-Vue][effect-ts-app:vue].

  - Next Level CLI via [Effect-CLI][@effect/cli:git] and [Effect's Terminal Pretty Printer][@effect/printer-ansi:git > examples/main].

  - [Changesets] with [Changeset-Conventional-Commits] to also cover and include the already common [Conventional Commits: A Better Way].
  
  - [Commitlint] ([Git][Commitlint-Git]) and [Commitizen] ([Git][Commitizen-Git]) for Conventional Commits - with combined [Config-Conventional]/[Config-PNPM-Scopes] and added type for `devops` and scope for `root` (`/` of monorepo).

  - [AntFu-ESLint-Config] plus [ESLint-Plugin-SonarJS] - *for even more rulez*.

    > Still considering switching to [Sheriff-ESLint-Config].

  - [Syncpack] ([Git][Syncpack-Git]) to keep packages within the monorepo in sync.
  
  - [NCU - NPM-Check-Updates] to check for and update packages within the monorepo.

  - [Hygen] code and configuration generator.
    
    > [...] ***hygen is contextual*** [...] ***it will automatically understand where it is in your code base and what generators are relevant for each part (think about monorepos)*** [...]."
    > 
    > [Hygen > Docs > FAQ > What's the difference from generator X/Y/Z?](https://www.hygen.io/docs/faq/#whats-the-difference-from-generator-xyz)

  - [PNPM] and [Bun] support - *with preference and focus for Bun*.

  - [Turborepo] for further growth - *great in productions with big monorepos*.

  - Mirroring to GitHub with option to pull in MRs (PRs in GitHub verbiage) from GitHub.

  - Dual project and issue management via [GitLab][mbr-demo-gitlab] and [GitHub][mbr-demo-github] - *GitLab with internal and GitHub with public focus*.

  - `.env` (Dotenv) driven global environment variables to make deployment hosts, IPs, devices, etc. configurable in one root config for all apps/packages within the monorepo.
    E.g. in case there're x capacitor based apps, they'll all be run on the developer's devices and emulators with the same commands and configs, instead of configuring each, and other such overhead.

    ```sh
    ANDROID_DEVICE = LGH83125ba2507
    ANDROID_VIRTUAL = Pixel_7_API_34
    IOS_DEVICE = 00042620-000441F34CC2791D
    IOS_VIRTUAL = 9C28C3C-E9DB-4548-929B-9B0869661DEF
    BASE_PORT = 7777
    ```

  - General heavy use of convenient package scripts by stacking.
    
    E.g. excerpt of `apps/nuxt-ionic/package.json`:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      ...
      "ca": "dotenv -- cap run --no-sync android",
      "ci": "dotenv -- cap run --no-sync ios",
      "cae": "npm run ca -- --target $ANDROID_VIRTUAL",
      "cad": "npm run ca -- --target $ANDROID_DEVICE",
      "cie": "npm run ci -- --target $IOS_VIRTUAL",
      "cid": "npm run ci -- --target $IOS_DEVICE",
      "cael": "npm run cae -- -l --port $BASE_PORT",
      "cadl": "npm run cad -- -l --port $BASE_PORT",
      "ciel": "npm run cie -- -l --port $BASE_PORT",
      "cidl": "npm run cid -- -l --port $BASE_PORT",
      ...
    }
    ```

  - More to come with [Ansible], [Docker]/[Podman] for dev environments, [Tilt] for transitional/staging dev, [K8s]/[K3s] for production on [FreeBSD] clusters using [Jails][freebsd-jails] and jailed [ContainerD] - *beside native Jails as "containers"*.

## Effect-TS

  - [Effect][effect-ts] already features a showcase of [Nuxt with Effect](https://github.com/effect-ts-app/boilerplate/tree/main/frontend/).

  According to a [recent Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/16w3iwn/comment/k36ddgj/), `Effect` obsoletes a myriad of packages, not limited to:
  - lodash/ramda/remeda/fp-ts/similar
  - express/koa/h3/other servers
  - react-query
  - redux/xstate/jotai/zustand/other state management
  - rxjs
  - purify-ts
  - date-fns and similar
  - inversify
  - zod/typebox/yup/joi/and so on
  - all stream related libs
  - axios/got/ky/superagent/similar


### Next Level CLI via Effect and Effect-CLI

  The now quite ready for prime-time [Effect-CLI][@effect/cli:git] looks promising:
  
  - The "(in)famous" in general "clean everything" of Effect,
  - part of an already whole universe of niceties,
  - replacing an otherwise hunch-load of partly even more or less rather legacy packages.

  Checking the [Example of ANSI Terminal Pretty Printer for Effect-TS][@effect/printer-ansi:git > examples/main], I'm already curious how well this [Pretty Printer for Effect-TS][@effect/printer:git] works for our output - as in CLI output, but looking at it, yeah, maybe it's also an option for more - eying on the actual `changeset`/`changelog` generation.



## FAQ/Explainers

  - Frontmatter, the leading "stuff" in between `---`

    Mostly just for the sake of it - to use it all the way along - seeing it more as a convention than an options.


  - Heavy use of comments within code

    Only for "core-dev" (still've to find a better wording) for easy, quick and definite comprehension of pitfalls, what changed and what's happening in general.

  
  - Mojis in comments - "Really, isn't that highly unprofessional?!"

    Back in the 00s and in final releases I would agree, but mostly same as with comments - just in "core-dev".
